      # The service CAFM â€“ Soft FM Requirements (Q.1) can only be selected when all other services are soft.
      # Because we don't want to pass that logic onto the user, we determine which CAFM service they need for them.
      # To make the selection easier we have added the Q.3 service for the user to select,
      # which we can then replace with the correct CAFM service at the appropriate time.
