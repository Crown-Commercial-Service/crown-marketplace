      TUPE, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) protects the rights of employees when the
      business or commercial
      contract that they are working on changes to new ownership. It ensures that employees who find themselves
      transferred to a new business,
      retain exactly the same hours and rate of pay as they were contracted to with the old employer.
