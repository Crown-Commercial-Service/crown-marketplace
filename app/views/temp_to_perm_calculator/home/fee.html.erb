      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p>This calculation is based on a daily supplier's fee of <%= number_to_currency(@calculator.daily_supplier_fee, unit: '£') %>. This fee is the supplier's proportion of the <%= number_to_percentage(@calculator.markup_rate * 100, precision: 1) %> mark-up on a <%= number_to_currency(@calculator.day_rate, unit: '£') %> daily rate. There were <%= @calculator.working_days %> working days between the date the worker started their contract <%= @calculator.contract_start_date.to_formatted_s(:long) %> and the date you intend to hire them, <%= @calculator.hire_date.to_formatted_s(:long) %>. The worker you wish to hire works <%= @calculator.days_per_week %> days per week and the total fee has been calculated on a pro-rata basis.</p>
