<p>Managed service providers</p>

<p>There are 2 kinds of managed service provider to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>A master vendor</strong> managed service supplies whatever candidates they can. Where they donâ€™t have a suitable candidate themselves, they find other suppliers who do.</p>

<p>You will then need to contact all the suppliers who meet your requirements and run a further competition.</p>

<p><strong>A neutral vendor</strong> managed service only provides candidates from other suppliers - they have no candidates of their own.</p>
