        start_paragraph: You will use your buildings to inform suppliers where you want particular services to be delivered to. Once set up, your buildings can be reused in this system for other FM procurements.
        start_warning: When creating your buildings, you are not restricted to creating just full buildings. For example, you may choose to set up just a floor within a building, or a specific area. Ultimately, your service pricing will be broken down to show a cost per service per 'building', allowing your to manage your contract effectively. You should therefore create buildings dependent on the level of detail you require.
