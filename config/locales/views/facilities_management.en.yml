Your uploaded buildings will then also appear within this screen for future use.
        start_warning_1: When creating your buildings, you are not restricted to create just full buildings, for example you may choose to set up just a floor or a specific area within a building. You may also set up an external area, such as a park, as a â€˜buildingâ€™.
        start_warning_2: Your service pricing will be broken down to show a cost per service per â€˜buildingâ€™, allowing you to manage your contract effectively. You should therefore create â€˜buildingsâ€™ dependent on the level of detail you require.
        start_warning_3: If you have a site, campus, group of buildings, these should be set up individually and not grouped together into one site.
