              standard_A: Regularly planned maintenance regime which aims to keep all elements of the structure, fabric and finishes and overall appearance of the Property at an acceptable performance level.
              standard_B: Will provide for an enhanced maintenance approach whereby certain elements of fabric require a higher level of attention due to the environment or circumstances in which it is situated. Used in very rare circumstances.
              standard_C: It is likely to offer unique challenges to the Supplier and require a deviation from the normal approach, with an enhanced or reduced fabric maintenance requirement (an example could be the maintenance of the front door for No 10, Downing Street which is constantly in the public eye).
            cleaning_standards:
              standard_A: Typical for all occupied or generally accessed areas including public access spaces and general office areas.
              standard_B: Typical for prestige and high visibility areas. This is classed as exceptional and should only be required in very rare circumstances.
              standard_C: Typical for highly sensitive or specialist areas such as laboratories, data centres etc, or for buildings that require a lesser service level e.g. mothballed buildings, garages or warehouses.
