      list_2_page_view: page view is not optimised for viewing on mobile devices
      list_2_text_reflow: the text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window. This means you may need to scroll horizontally (across instead of up and down) on certain pages
      many_of_our_older: Many of our older PDFs and Word documents do not meet accessibility standards – for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).
      market_place_link: https://marketplace.service.crowncommercial.gov.uk/facilities-management
      non_text_contrast_heading: Non-Text Contrast
      non_text_contrast_issue: When reviewing pages there is not enough contrast between the visual boundaries of user interface components in a selected or focus state and the background. This mainly affects buttons and some text input fields on certain pages.
      non_text_contrast_this_falls: This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.4.11(b) (non-text contrast). We plan to fix this by October 2020.
      page_optimisation_heading: Pages not optimised for mobile
      page_optimisation_issue: When viewing the website on mobile devices, pages with tables render incorrectly and may be hard to interpret by users. This mainly affects pages with tables with a high number of columns and content.
      page_optimisation_this_falls: This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow). We plan to fix this by October 2020.
      pdfs_and_docs: PDFs and other documents
      plan_to_fix: By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.
      some_of_our: Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with contract information, and forms published as Word documents.
      the_complete_journey: The complete Facilities Management journey was tested, this included every page a buyer or supplier would progress through in-order to complete the procurement activity.  The administration screens used for the maintenance of the digital service were also tested for accessibility, this area of functionality is only used by a small selection of CCS staff.

      two_D_heading: Two-dimensional scrolling is present
      two_D_issue: When viewing pages at 1280px width and 400% zoom, two-dimensional scrolling is required to view content. This mainly affects pages with tables with a high number of columns and content.
      two_D_this_falls: This fails WCAG 2.1 AA success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow). We plan to fix this by October 2020.
