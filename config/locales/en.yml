      list_1_change_colours: change colours, contrast levels and fonts
      list_1_navigate_keyboard: navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
      list_1_navigate_listen: listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
      list_1_navigate_speach: navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
      list_2_contrast: the contrast on some text may not be enough
      list_2_page_view: page view is not optimised for viewing on mobile devices
      list_2_text_reflow: the text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window. This means you may need to scroll horizontally (across instead of up and down) on certain pages
      many_of_our_older: Many of our older PDFs and Word documents do not meet accessibility standards – for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).
      market_place_link: https://marketplace.service.crowncommercial.gov.uk/facilities-management
      non_text_contrast_heading: Non-Text Contrast

      plan_to_fix: By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.
