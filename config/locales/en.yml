      list_2_contrast: the contrast on some text may not be enough
      list_2_page_view: page view is not optimised for viewing on mobile devices
      list_2_text_reflow: the text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window. This means you may need to scroll horizontally (across instead of up and down) on certain pages
      many_of_our_older: Many of our older PDFs and Word documents do not meet accessibility standards – for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).
